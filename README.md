# Billeasy-Assessment

- Design Database tables for employees and departments in POSTGRESQL.
- Create an API using Node.js, you are free to use any framework for this of your choice (preferred Strongloop)
- The API should be able to create a new employee, a new department, return data of the employee querying joins from the two tables and show a result set to a specific employee ID.
- Create a Trigger on the Employee table. Maintain a count of employees in each department(REFERENCE to department table) - trigger should increase the count as and when the employee is inserted.
- Create a function in DB to return JSON of all employee details in a department based on the time they joined the company (time range filter along with department filter).
